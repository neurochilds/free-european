# Free European
A Google Chrome plugin to bypass the paywall blocking access to The New European articles.

1. Download the folder containing content.js and manifest.json 

2. Upload the folder as a Google Chrome extension:
     Google Chrome > Extensions > Manage Extensions > Load unpacked > Select and load the folder containing content.js and manifest.json

3. Navigate to the extension and select 'This Can Read and Change Site Data' > 'When You Click the Extension'

4. Load The New European article you wish to view and click on the extension to activate it. The previously hidden article content will now be rendered on the page. If you continue navigating The New European without closing the window, you will have full access to any article you view without having to reactivate the extension.
